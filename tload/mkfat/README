This is mkfat, a simple utility for generating FAT filesystem images from a
directory in the current filesystem.

Building
--------

mkfat requires a functioning C++ compiler and the Boost C++ libraries.  To
build:

./configure
make
make install

Optionally, the included Visual C++ project can be used on Windows.


Usage
-----

mkfat [-o image_file] [-F32] source

Make a FAT image from the files contained within 'source'.  If the -o option is
specified, this is written to the file 'image_file', else it is written to
stdout.

If -F32 is specified, then mkfat will guarantee that a fat32 image is created.
This is required by some hardware UEFI implementations (not OVMF).  Note that
this will require that the image file is at least ~32 MiB (it may well be
somewhere between 32 and 64 MiB even if the size of the files contained on it
sum to well less than 32 MiB).


Acknowledgements
----------------

mkfat heavily depends on the fatfs library available from:
