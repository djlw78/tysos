tinygc and dlmalloc with some modifications and packaged for tysos

To compile, run make gc.<arch>.o
e.g:
	make gc.x86_64.o
	make gc.i386.o
	make gc.arm.o

edit Makefile to define the names of your compilers

The resultant output requires sbrk(), exit() and abort() to be defined.  ARM
output will require -lgcc in the final link (for __aeabi_uidiv).

See dlmalloc.c and README.txt for the licences of dlmalloc and tinygc
respectively.  All modifications to tinygc are released under the GNU GPL v2.

tinygc is available from http://tinygc.sourceforge.net
dlmalloc is available from http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html
