This directory contains the source for the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage
collector (http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc) version 7.2d.  See
README.QUICK for more details.

It has been modified by John Cronin <jncronin@tysos.org> to define a new
target 'TYSOS' and to support building in a freestanding environment (all 
#if __STDC_HOSTED__ preprocessor directives).
