Tysos - the typesafe operating system
http://www.tysos.org

Copyright (C) 2008-2011 John Cronin


Requirements:

- The Microsoft .NET build system from the .NET 3.5 release or mono >= 2.10
- Mtools (http://mtools.linux.lu)
- Binutils cross-compiled to support both i586-elf and x86_64-elf targets
- Gcc cross-compiled to support i586-elf targets
- Bzip2
- Grub (version 1.96 or greater)

Mtools and appropriate cross compiles of gcc and binutils are available from the tysos website for Cygwin.

Note that you need to be able to natively run CLR executables in your host
operating system.  In Linux this can be enabled by adding binfmt_misc support
(on Debian - apt-get install binfmt-support) and then (from the shell) running
echo ':CLR:M::MZ::/path/to/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
See http://www.mono-project.com/Guide:Running_Mono_Applications for more
details.


Build instructions:

- Simply type 'make' in the root directory of the source to build an iso image
    in the iso_image directory which can be run under VirtualBox.  While it
    is possible to run tysos on a real machine this is not supported and
    MAY DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER and as such is not supported by us (i.e. do this
    at your own risk).
